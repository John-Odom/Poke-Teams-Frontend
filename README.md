## Poke Teams Frontend

This React/Rails app is used to build pokemon teams.  It pulls data from an external API (pokeapi.com) to gather the current Pokemon.  Then it only uses the first 151 characters from the original pokemon.

### Developing locally

This project uses Ruby on Rails to start the databases and JavaScrript with React to render on-screen changes.  To start the frontend, I would suggest first kicking up the databases.  You can find the backend at https://github.com/John-Odom/Poke-Teams-Backend.  Read that ReadMe to kick up the APIs. 

Once you have the databases running, you will need to cd back into the frontend directory.  Then:

Run this command:
```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Then you should be good to start developing.
